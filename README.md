Description
===========
The **Cambridge Communications Assessment Model** is a decision support tool to quantify the performance of national digital infrastructure strategies for fixed and mobile broadband, using different fixed, wireless and satellite technologies. The tool currently consists of two sub-models, one for use with fixed broadband networks, and the other for use with 4G and 5G mobile networks.

Setup and configuration
=======================

All code for **The Cambridge Communications Assessment Model** is written in
Python (Python>=3.5) and has a number of dependencies.
See `requirements.txt` for a full list.

Using conda
-----------

The recommended installation method is to use [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html),
which handles packages and virtual environments,
along with the `conda-forge` channel which has a host of pre-built libraries and packages.

Create a conda environment, using `digital_comms` as a short reference for digital communications:

    conda create --name digital_comms python=3.5
  
Activate it (run each time you switch projects)::

    activate pysim5g

First, install required packages including `fiona`, `shapely`, `numpy`, `rtree`, `pyproj` and `pytest`:

    conda install fiona shapely numpy rtree pyproj pytest pandas

For development purposes, run this command once per machine:

    python setup.py develop

To install digital_comms permanently:

    python setup.py install

The run the tests:

    python setup.py test


Background and funding
==========================

The **Cambridge Communications Assessment Model** has been collaboratively developed between the [Environmental Change Institute](http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), the [Networks and Operating Systems Group (NetOS)](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos) at the [Cambridge Computer Laboratory](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk),  and the UK's [Digital Catapult](http://www.digtalcatapult.org.uk). Research activity between 2017-2018 also took place at the [Cambridge Judge Business School](http://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/home/) at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/).

Development has been funded by the EPSRC via (i) the [Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium](http://www.itrc.org.uk/) (EP/N017064/1) and (ii) the UK's [Digital Catapult](http://www.digicatapult.org.uk) Researcher in Residence programme.
